In this, Object is created only once and that object is used again and again.

Example:
Suppose you want to perform CRUD operation in your java applications. For this you need to connect your java application with Database via JDBC.
Then for this, we no need to create object again and again to connect with database.
Here we will create only one object and that will make connection with database and perform CRUD.

Steps: 
# make constructor private
# make a private static variable of class
# make a method public static which will return class object
# we will create object with the help of method
