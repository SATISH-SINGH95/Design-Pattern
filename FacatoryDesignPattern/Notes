When there is superclass and multiple subclasses and we want to get object of subclasses based on input and requirement,
Then we create factory class which takes the responsibility of creating object of the class base on input.

#Advantage of Factory design pattern : 
    * Focus on creating object for intrface rather than implementation.
    * Loose coupling, more robust code.
